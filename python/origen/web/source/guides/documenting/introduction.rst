Introduction
============

"Documenting" can apply to several aspects of Origen. You could document:

* Patterns
* Programs
* Flows
* Applications

In this section, we'll talk about documenting the applications themselves. See 
:link-to:`the pattern API <patgen:comments>` and
:link-to:`the program API <prog-gen:comments>`
topics for documenting pattern and program sources, respectively.

Any application created with ``origen new`` will already have the pieces in place to generate a
:static_website:`static website <>`, which itself allows for self-contained
webpages which can easily be served by a web server or packaged up and distributed without introducing any
dependencies on the end users.

Your Origen application documentation engine features:

* A fully-functioning :sphinx_app:`Sphinx app <>` out-of-the-box.
* Integration of the |ose|, which ties into your *Origen application* and the |web_cmd| command.
* An fully-featured :bootstrap4:`bootstrap4 <>`-derived :sphinx_themes:`theme <>`
  with the :darkly:`darkly <>` overlay and :dracula_pygments:`dracula <>` syntax highlighting.

Basic Build Command
-------------------

The entry point into Origen's doc generation is the |web_cmd| command. Take a moment to run the
following in your workspace to get an idea of the initial state of your application's docs:

.. code-block:: none

  origen web build --view

This command will build the webpages, placing them in your |web_output_dir| and launch
your system's web browser to view the resulting contents. This will yield webpages specific
to your application which have the same look and feel as the Origen documentation.

See the |web_cmd| section or run ``origen web -h`` from your terminal for more details.

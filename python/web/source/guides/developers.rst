Developers
==========

The pages here will introduce you to the implementation and architectural aspects required to develop
the :origen_github_home:`origen core <>` itself. Although
geared more towards existing or future developers, users which want a more *under-the-hood* view of Origen
will find this section interesting.

For future developers, please see the |community_contributions| section for an overview of contributing
to the core.

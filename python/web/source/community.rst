Community
=========

The ``Origen Core`` is maintained by a inter-company team who use it to facilitate their daily jobs.
As such, most of the current and planned features are based around use cases faced by the
|core_team| or from intra-company requests, however, external feedback in the form of bug reports,
feature requests, discussions, and contributions are always welcome.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

To report a bug, visit the |issues_page| on the |github_home|
and apply the label ``bug``, as well as any other appropriate labels. When opening an issue, please also included:

* A high-level description of the problem.
* The expected behavior vs. the observed behavior.
* Any examples which further show the above - the more defined the examples the easier it is to track down.
* Any particular environment notes, such as Windows vs. Linux, Git vs. Design Sync, etc.

Subsequent discussions may further refine the problem or spawn other issues. Once work has begun on a particular issue,
its progress can be tracked on the |project_tracker|.

Even |so_tag| questions or :origen_issues_bugs:`bug_reports <>` which end up as false-positives can be useful as they may indicate
confusing features or insufficient documentation. Additionally, the report will be recorded and viewable by all, which may
help others contemplating the same issue - so please don't hesitate!

Feature Requests
----------------

New feature request or expansion on existing features can be requested and discussed on
:origen_issues_home:`the same page` by applying the ``feature`` tag.

When requesting a new or expanded feature, please include:

* A description of the problem not currently solved by Origen
* A high-level overview of how the feature would be used.

  * In the event of API changes, please also include some example usages and results, especially if an
    API is desired.

* Before-and-after examples - the more defined, the better.
* If known, any low-level details which may affect implementation.
* Any corner-cases which come to mind.

Discussions will subsequently take place where the problem and proposed solution will be further refined. If accepted,
and once implementation work has begun, the |project_tracker| will be updated appropriately.

Contributing
------------

Contributions are always welcome and are a great way to get more intricately involved with the Origen project.
If you're interested in contributing the Origen core, see the |developers:home|
section for notes on setting up a development environment, running tests, and
documentation updates.

Contributions should come in as :git_pull_requests:`pull request <>` and accompanied by a description,
any implementation notes, appropriate regression tests, documentation updates, and any usage notes
(such as, *"only works on Linux"* or *"only tested with the V93K"*, etc.).
